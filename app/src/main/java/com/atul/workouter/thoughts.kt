Every routine will have a last done date.
Every exercise will have a last done date.
Every exericse in routinr will have an priority order integer.
Every exercise can be done today or not will be determined if the last done date of higher priority exercise has crossed or equaled the last done date of the routine. If yes, then the exercise can be done today other wise that exercise cannot be done today.

When creating an exercise we will ask the user how often this exercise needs to be done, like every 1 day, 2 day, 3 day, 4 day, 5 day, 6 day, 7 day, 14 day, 21 day, 28 day, 30 day, 60 day, 90 day, 180 day, 365 day.
This will be the priority of each exercise.

So when starting an exercise we will check if all higher priority exercise have been done or not. If yes then we will allow the user to do the exercise. If not then we will not allow the user to do the exercise.

Even if the exercise can be done today or not can be determined by how much days gap is there between the last done date of the exercise and the current date. If the gap is less than the priority of the exercise then the exercise cannot be done. If the gap is more than the priority of the exercise then the exercise can be done.

Sounds good.
